### Daniel's Learning

### Ren's Learning
What I learned is that debugging can take take more time than we plan it to. So it is better to plan out with a lot of time remaining so that it can get done. I also learned that React and CSS do not always get along and some styling can be overwritten if they have the same names in different components. React was also a good challenge which taught me how to use handleSubmit and handleChange while passing objects as props from another component.
